          <li id="texts6">Vienna Bakery began in Edmonton in 1959 located next to Jasper Place Meats along Stony Plain road and about 151 street. We relocated to our previous “off <br>Whyte” space in the early 1990s. Our story might have ended there once Bernie and Brigitte Jaeger (my parents) decided to retire. I was looking at other career <br>opportunities and had left baking behind me for a while.</li>
          <li id="texts6">It was during my time at another bakery that I decided to re-enter the bakery world, but this time as an owner. Along with the support of many close friends and<br>family I had purchased a part of Bagel Bin bakery in 2008. At the time, we were only a wholesale bakery and quickly realized the potential to bring great baking <br>back to Edmonton for everyone. We moved again and opened up a small retail space where we could share many of the traditional recipes from Vienna <br>Bakery’s history.</li>
          <li id="texts7">Together, with our great Vienna Bakery family, we enjoy bringing you our favourite breads, pastry, cakes, and much more.</li>
          <li id="texts7">Great times are often centered on great food. We want to do our best to bring this to you.</li>
          <li id="texts7">Thanks for stopping and shopping with us.</li>
          <li id="texts7">Wishing you a great day,</li>
          <strong id="texts8">Brian</strong>
          <li id="texts9">We have customers visiting our Wholesale Bakery from across Edmonton, Sherwood Park, St. Albert, Leduc, Spruce Grove, and the surrounding areas.</li><br>
